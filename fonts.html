        Oh c'mon, this is bullshit! <span>I mean look at this dude, alright?</span> 
        He doesn't even know what planet he's living on! You ever, have like a wild animal trapped in your house? 
        Opossum - big, freaky, lookin' bitch. Hey, since when did they change it to opossum? What's up with that? When I was comin' up it was just possum. 
        Opossum makes it sound like he's Irish or something. 
        Why do they gotta go changing everything?

        Oh well, heil Hitler, bitch! And let me tell you something else. So what're you saying?
         Like, I shot someone with, like, a gun?
         We flipped a coin, okay? You and me.
         You and me! Coin flip is sacred! Your job is waiting for you in that basement, as per the coin!
